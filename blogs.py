    I not only build stuff, but I also write about it. Here are some of the blogs I have written:

    ### -- [The Deep Learning Master Class](https://medium.com/@ngechamike26/the-deep-learning-master-class-the-series-41034bb855e3)

    In this article series, I explain how this seemingly complex technology works by dissecting it to its core, then building it back up. We will build an understanding of deep learning and neural networks from the beginning such that it will be very easy to understand concepts like convolutional Neural Networks, Sequence modeling, Transformers, Reinforcement Learning and Text to Image generation.

        ### -- [Data Science for Beginners: 2023â€“2024 Complete Road Map.](https://medium.com/@ngechamike26/data-science-for-beginners-2023-2024-complete-road-map-89d709fad777)

        We have all heard people introduce themselves as data scientists, and you wonder, what do these guys do? Then you went online to look at job descriptions, and you realized that there are many different descriptions, so you gave up. Or this is your first search, and you want to know what exactly data science is. Here you will know what it all involves, and find a map to lead you from your noviceship to a complete baller.

    ### -- [Advanced Python Concepts.](https://medium.com/@ngechamike26/advanced-python-concepts-27d7d42f276e)

    In this series, we will cover some advanced python concepts to optimize python code wherever you use it. These are not specialized concepts like in Data Science or Web development, they are general python concepts that will be useful to optimize your python code wherever you apply it.

EDA is the bridge between raw data and meaningful insight. This is where data analysts and data scientists find out and summarize key characteristics of data. Why is it important?......    """
