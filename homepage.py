        - Working with structured (csv and tsv) data and unstructured data like photos and videos.

        - Descriptive, prescriptive, and mostly, Predictive data Analysis.

        - Machine Learning Modelling with Python's extensive library.

        - Deep Learning and Neural Networks with Tensorflow and the Keras API.

        - FastAI for Deep learning tasks uncool again (Their words, not mine).

        - Data ETL(ish).

       ##### Web Technologies

        - Web APIs with python's Django and FastAPI.
